# OS Module

Find docs by searching nodejs.org:OS or by going to the [currently used Met Office version, 14.x](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v14.x/api/os.html).

This module allows the user to interact with the operating system, finding information about things like:

- cpu
- network interface
- platform currently running
- current user info

This module is probably most useful when running docker containers, which can choose the best code to execute based on the current OS used by the user deploying the container. I could (and most probably) be wrong about this application of the OS module, but it's certainly a cool thing to play with.
